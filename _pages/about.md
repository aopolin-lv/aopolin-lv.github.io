<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year M.S. student at [Institute of Artifical Intellgence](http://iai.suda.edu.cn/) of [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/), advised by Associate Prof. [Ziqiang Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=06ITfcEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Guohong Fu](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/G.-Fu/2059275). I am so honour to work with them. Before, I received B.S. degree in Software engineering from the same school.

I am intersted in natural language processing. Previously, I did some simple attempts to the Chinese Spelling Check task, and in future I would like to investigate the robustness, explainable of NLP models.
