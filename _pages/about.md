Hi, my name is Qi Lv (ÂêïÂ•á). I am currently a first-year Ph.D student in Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen) and Great Bay University, advised by [Xiang Deng](https://xiang-deng-dl.github.io/), [Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/index.html), and [Michael Yu Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=Oo7c22wAAAAJ). Before, I received M.S and B.E in Software engineering from Soochow University, supervised by [Ziqiang Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=06ITfcEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Guohong Fu](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Guohong_Fu1).

I am now interested in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and robotic learning. Specifically, I am investigating how to leverage MLLMs to empower embodied agents which consists of high-level task planning and low-level motion control. Previously, I devoted to exploring natural language understanding during the master period.
