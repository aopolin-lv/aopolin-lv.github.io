<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year M.S. student at [Institute of Artifical Intellgence](http://iai.suda.edu.cn/) of [Soochow University](https://www.suda.edu.cn/), advised by Associate Prof. [Ziqiang Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=06ITfcEAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and Prof. [Guohong Fu](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/G.-Fu/2059275). I am so honour to work with them. Before, I received B.S. degree in Software engineering from the same school.

I am interested in natural language processing and curious about many of the issues involved. Before that, I started my research for more than a year and made some simple attempts on the Chinese Spell Checking task. In the future, I would like to investigate natural language processing more deeply and explore more from a cognitive perspective.

I am looking for Ph.d. opportunites. Meanwhile, I want to cooperate with nice researchers and keep learning from them. On average, I spend 50+ hours per week in NLP related research.
